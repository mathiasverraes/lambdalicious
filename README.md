Experiments in Elegant Functional Programming in PHP

![Lambda Man by Martin Grabmüller](docs/lambda-man.jpg "Lambda Man by Martin Grabmüller")

## Design Goals

- Decorate, wrap, fork, copy/paste, borrow, steal shamelessly from smarter people than myself!
- Allow you to write beautiful, elegant, and expressive code, with a high signal-to-noise rate!
- Gloriously global! Polluting your global namespace? Think of it as cleaning up your global namespace!
- Higher order functions baby!
- LISPlike Love for Lists!



## FAQ

### Can you backport it to older PHP versions?

Boring, next question please.

### Should I use it? Is it ready for production?

If you can't make that decision for yourself, don't use it.

### How can I contribute?

I like you already! Use it, fix broken stuff, implement missing features from the libs listed below, measure and optimize performance, have awesome ideas.
